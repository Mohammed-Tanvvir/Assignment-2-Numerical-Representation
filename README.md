# Assignment 2: Numerical Representation

This C++ program takes two integer inputs, **num1** and **num2**, and generates a numerical representation for each integer in the range from **num1** to **num2** (inclusive). The representation is based on the following rules:

1. If the integer is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), it prints the textual representation of that number (e.g., 1 is represented as "one").
2. If the integer is even, it prints "even."
3. If the integer is odd and not in the range 1 to 9, it prints "odd."
